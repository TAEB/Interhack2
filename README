Build and install with:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

This will put 'interhack' into your PATH so you can run it from anywhere. It
also installs the Interhack modules into a place Perl can easily find them.

The build process will fetch CPAN dependencies for you, so no need to fiddle
with that any more. Yay.
